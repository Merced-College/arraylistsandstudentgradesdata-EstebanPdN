Reflection:

For me the hardest part was reading and parsing the CSV file correctly. 
At first, I was having an issue with the file paths and formatting, but I got it after a little bit of testing, I learned how to split lines and convert strings to integers. 
I think ArrayList are really helpfull, it is the first time I store one inside an object and use it in a real program. So it was really cool.
